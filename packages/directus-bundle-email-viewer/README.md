# Directus Email Viewer
Fetch all emails sent and received by your organization (or a subset of your organization's users) for a given email address, and list the metadata in a searchable interface. Very usefull for an internal CRM application, where you want to see teamwide email correspondence for any of the stored contacts.

## Features
- üéÅ **Stylish UI Component**: Adds a presentation interface where emails are rendered in a stylish UI component. Extra metadata, such as a preview of the email body, is shown in the expanded state of an email.
- üîç **Search and Filter**: Adds search, filter, and limit inputs to the interface. The values are stored in local storage, so filter presets are applied each time you open Directus.
- üíå **Email Threads**: View email threads directly in Directus (if configured). The email HTML is sanitized with DOMPurify to prevent nasty business.
- üìß **Fetch Emails**: Adds endpoints that fetch emails from the selected provider based on user input.
- ü™¨ **Granular Permissions**: Adds fields to Directus Policies that provide granular permissions, allowing you to configure which users can view which email inboxes.
- üëÄ **Internal Email Filtering**: Internal email traffic is filtered by default and cannot be read by any user, including admin users (to maintain privacy).
- üïµÔ∏è **Privacy Configurations**: Optional privacy-focused configurations allow you to filter entire email accounts or emails labeled with a specific tag.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Schema changes
This extension makes modifications to your existing database schema. It adds fields to `directus_policies`. This should not interfere with any of you existing data.

However, if you don't want this extension to modify your schema, or want more control over field configuration, you can disable it by setting one of these env vars:

`EMAIL_VIEWER_DISABLE_SCHEMA_CHANGE="true"`   
`DISABLE_EXTENSION_SCHEMA_CHANGE="true"` (globally applied to all [@onderwijsin](https://github.com/onderwijsin/directus-extensions/tree/feat/cache-flush) extensions)   
   
If you disable schema modifications, you're responsible for the availability of the necessary collections and fields! Please check the `./schema.ts` file for reference.

## Installation
Refer to the [Official Guide](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/installing-extensions.html) for details on installing the extension from the Marketplace or manually.

## Configuration
To use this extension in your Directus app, you'll need to follow the steps below.

1. Choose your organizations email provider (you can find a list of supported providers below)
2. Add the necessary env variables. These mainly consist of authentication tokens for connecting with the provider, and:
    - `EMAIL_VIEWER_PROVIDER="<provider>"`
    - `CLIENT_CACHE_TTL` (how long should email data be cached, in seconds)
3. Configure access policies. By default, none of the existing policies, including admin policies, have access to emails. When you navigate to Settings > Access policies, you'll notice that there is a new field in each policy: `Email Viewer Permission`. This field can have one of five values: 
   - `none`: user has access to none of the email
   - `self`: user has access to email sent or received by themselves
   - `domain`: user has access to email sent or received by addresses that share their domain name
   - `all`: user has access to all of the organization's email
   - `specific`: provide a set of specific email addresses the user has access to
4. (Optional) Navigate to Settings and configure global settings
   - **Add excluded email addresses**. Emails belonging to this account are filtered globally (i.e. for all users), except for the user the email belongs to
   - **Add Excluded email tags**. Emails that contain this tag (or category) are filtered globally (i.e. for all users), including the user the email belongs to
   - **Show email body in viewer**. If enabled, the entore email body wil be visible for all users that have permisison to view this email.
5. (Optional) Navigate to User and configure user specific settings
  - **Add tags to filter**.  Emails that contain this tag (or category) are filtered for the inbox belonging to the email address this user is registrerd by


You can find specific docs on how to get the proper token within the provider's directory.
