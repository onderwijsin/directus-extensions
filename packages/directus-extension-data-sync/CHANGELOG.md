# @onderwijsin/directus-extension-data-sync

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6c1b2be: BREAKING!: update the collection name that is used for storing remote sources
  Both the remote sources collection and it's junction to directus_users have a new name: data_sync_remote_sources. This is done so that the collection name directly refers to the extension.
  If you already have the remote_data_sources and remote_data_source_directus_users collections in your system, you need to manually remove them after migrating you data to the new collection

### Patch Changes

- 22299eb: âœ¨ Disable automated schema changes
  If you don't want an extension to modify your database schema, you can now disable it. This can either be done globally, or per extension. Beware that if you disbale schema changes, you are responsible for providing the changes yourself. The extensions still rely on certain collections and fields.

  - add disableSchemaChange utility
  - check environment vars for config settings, only trigger schema changes accordingly
  - update readme

- 504dcf9: Implement new createNotification utility
- 24e24d1: Add eventContext to services
  If you do not pass the existing db connection to the service it will use the default DB connection which deadlocks the db for sqlite
