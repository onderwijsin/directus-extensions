- 04116e2: ## Implementation of ESLint

  ### Overview

  We have implemented ESLint in the project to ensure code quality and consistency. The implementation follows the standards set by `@directus/eslint-config` and was guided by the Directus Labs extensions monorepo.

  ### Configuration

  The ESLint configuration is based on `@directus/eslint-config` with some custom overrides to better fit our project's needs. These overrides are specified in `eslint.config.mjs`.

  ### Steps Taken

  1. **Installation**: Installed ESLint and the `@directus/eslint-config` package.
  2. **Configuration**: Created and customized the `eslint.config.mjs` file to include necessary overrides.
  3. **Integration**: Integrated ESLint into the project's build and CI processes to ensure continuous code quality checks.
  4. **Linting**: Ran ESLint across the entire codebase and fixed all identified linting errors.
  5. **Update docs**: added info on eslint to README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md

  ### Benefits

  - **Consistency**: Ensures consistent coding styles across the project.
  - **Quality**: Helps in identifying and fixing potential issues early in the development process.
  - **Maintainability**: Makes the codebase easier to maintain and understand.
