## üëã Introduction
This repository contains extensions for [Directus](https://directus.io) that we‚Äôve developed for our projects. Some of these extensions are actively maintained, while others may not be.  

Certain extensions serve a very specific purpose and have only been tested in our environment. As a result, they may not work in other Directus instances. That being said, you are more than welcome to try them out!

## üì¶ Packages
Some extensions in this repository are (or will be) published to the Directus Marketplace. Please note that none of these extensions are [sandboxed](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/sandbox/introduction.html), so they will only be discoverable if you set [`MARKETPLACE_TRUST=all`](https://directus.io/docs/configuration/extensions#marketplace).

- [`directus-extension-slugify-operation`](https://github.com/onderwijsin/directus-extensions/blob/main/packages/directus-extension-slugify-operation)   
  Adds a flow operation to slugify inputs.
- [`directus-bundle-sluggernaut`](https://github.com/onderwijsin/directus-extensions/blob/main/packages/directus-bundle-sluggernaut)  
  A set of five extensions that handle and automate slugs, paths and redirects.
- [`directus-bundle-email-viewer`](https://github.com/onderwijsin/directus-extensions/tree/main/packages/directus-bundle-email-viewer)   
  Fetch and view your team's email to and from a given email address, without ever leaving Directus
- [`directus-extension-data-sync`](https://github.com/onderwijsin/directus-extensions/tree/main/packages/directus-extension-data-sync)   
  Sync data between different Directus instances that share (part of their) collection data schema
- [`directus-extension-cache-flush`](https://github.com/onderwijsin/directus-extensions/tree/main/packages/directus-extension-cache-flush)   
  Send requests to (front end) applications if data changes in Directus. Fully configurable for specific collections and events.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development
This repo uses Docker and pnpm. You'll need to have Docker Desktop with compose, and pnpm installed on your system.

After cloning the repo, run ``pnpm dev`` in the root directory to automatically rebuild packages on file changes. This goes for any package in the ``./packages`` directory.

With Docker compose you can mount a Directus instance to test your extension code. This repo contains two compose files you can use:
- ``docker-compose.yml`` for mounting a single Directus instance with database and Redis cache. Run `pnpm start` to use.
- ``network.docker-compose.yml`` for mounting a network of three Directus instances with seperate databases. Especially useful for scenario's where you need your Directus instance to interact with other instances. Run `pnpm network` to start

### üíΩ Databases
The default database used in this project is a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extension. For the default compose file, different profiles have been set up to test extensions for other database providers. Each of the database providers that Directus supports, has it's own profile (except for cloud databases, such as Redshift and Aurora). You can use these profiles by running `pnpm start:{profile}` (such as `pnpm start:sqlite`). Check this projects `package.json` for a full list of providers.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Schema changes
Some of the extensions in this repo make modifications to your existing database schema. Some add fields to existing (system) collections, while others add new collections to your data model. Neither of these should interfere with any of you existing data.

However, if you don't want an extension to modify your schema, or want more control over field configuration, you can disable it by setting this env var:

`DISABLE_EXTENSION_SCHEMA_CHANGE="true"`

This will apply to any of the extensions in this repo. You can also configure this option on a per extension basis (see each extension's docs for more details)

If you disable schema modifications, you're responsible for the availability of the necessary collections and fields! Please check the `./schema.ts` file in the relevant extensions src folder for reference.

## ü§ù Contributing
