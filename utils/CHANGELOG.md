- 04116e2: ## Implementation of ESLint

  ### Overview

  We have implemented ESLint in the project to ensure code quality and consistency. The implementation follows the standards set by `@directus/eslint-config` and was guided by the Directus Labs extensions monorepo.

  ### Configuration

  The ESLint configuration is based on `@directus/eslint-config` with some custom overrides to better fit our project's needs. These overrides are specified in `eslint.config.mjs`.

  ### Steps Taken

  1. **Installation**: Installed ESLint and the `@directus/eslint-config` package.
  2. **Configuration**: Created and customized the `eslint.config.mjs` file to include necessary overrides.
  3. **Integration**: Integrated ESLint into the project's build and CI processes to ensure continuous code quality checks.
  4. **Linting**: Ran ESLint across the entire codebase and fixed all identified linting errors.
  5. **Update docs**: added info on eslint to README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md

  ### Benefits

  - **Consistency**: Ensures consistent coding styles across the project.
  - **Quality**: Helps in identifying and fixing potential issues early in the development process.
  - **Maintainability**: Makes the codebase easier to maintain and understand.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- b27e444: Add pruneObjByFieldKeys to utils

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 22299eb: âœ¨ Disable automated schema changes
  If you don't want an extension to modify your database schema, you can now disable it. This can either be done globally, or per extension. Beware that if you disbale schema changes, you are responsible for providing the changes yourself. The extensions still rely on certain collections and fields.

  - add disableSchemaChange utility
  - check environment vars for config settings, only trigger schema changes accordingly
  - update readme

- 8413a05: Add createNotification function, which is a utility for the notifications service which defaults applied
- 24e24d1: Add eventContext to services
  If you do not pass the existing db connection to the service it will use the default DB connection which deadlocks the db for sqlite

- 563f26e: Fix items services in sqlite by proving existing DB connextion (attempt 2)
